              Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest
              challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in
              extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015,
              too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs. As
              of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90
              a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid
              growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions
              out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more
              likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work,
              education, and own less property. Progress has also been limited
              in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which
              account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New
              threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food
              insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of
              poverty. The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started,
              and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves
              targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and
              services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and
              climate-related disasters.

              The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in
              the past two decades because of rapid economic growth and
              increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries
              that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their
              nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the
              Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme
              hunger. Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a
              huge barrier to development in many countries. There are 821
              million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of
              2017, often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation,
              drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five
              are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe food
              insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of
              Africa, as well as in South America. The SDGs aim to end all forms
              of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all
              people–especially children–have sufficient and nutritious food all
              year. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural, supporting
              small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology and
              markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure
              investment in infrastructure and technology to improve
              agricultural productivity.

              We have made great progress against several leading causes of
              death and disease. Life expectancy has increased dramatically;
              infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, we’ve turned
              the tide on HIV and malaria deaths have halved. Good health is
              essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects
              the complexity and interconnectedness of the two. It takes into
              account widening economic and social inequalities, rapid
              urbanization, threats to the climate and the environment, the
              continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and
              emerging challenges such as noncommunicable diseases. Universal
              health coverage will be integral to achieving SDG 3, ending
              poverty and reducing inequalities. Emerging global health
              priorities not explicitly included in the SDGs, including
              antimicrobial resistance, also demand action. But the world is
              off-track to achieve the health-related SDGs. Progress has been
              uneven, both between and within countries. There’s a 31-year gap
              between the countries with the shortest and longest life
              expectancies. And while some countries have made impressive gains,
              national averages hide that many are being left behind.
              Multisectoral, rights-based and gender-sensitive approaches are
              essential to address inequalities and to build good health for
              all.
